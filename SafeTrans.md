**SAFE TRANSITIONS**  
**SWADDLING DUES** ðŸ›Œ  

1. **FEEL THE SPACE**:  
   Slow, soft, feel the space. Stay calm.  
   Breathe deep, hold peace in your chest.  

2. **SAY IT CLEAR**:  
   Speak with care, with truth and love.  
   Let the words flow slow, not harsh.  

3. **GIVE THE SPACE**:  
   Let them sit, let them think.  
   Let no rush push, let time heal.  

4. **ASK AND LISTEN**:  
   Ask how they feel, what they need.  
   Listen close, no rush, just hear.  

5. **USE YOUR HANDS**:  
   Touch soft, if it's safe, with care.  
   Help them rest, ease their load.  

6. **MOVE WITH LOVE**:  
   When you shift, shift with care.  
   Give grace, give time, give trust.  

7. **BRING THEM CLOSE**:  
   Let them lean, let them know.  
   Wrap them close in love, not force.  

8. **BE THE PEACE**:  
   Hold the calm, hold the peace.  
   Let love lead, let fear fade
